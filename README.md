# Learning Kubernetes with Minecraft Servers

## Why?
Since i was 14 years old, i have been developing [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/),[BungeeCord] plugins, and consequently handling Linux based servers.  
In spigot plugins you have to create SQL queries,consume web apis, handle server FPS, create a database structure, create proxies, and others. So i want to combine the business with pleasure. Due to the complexity of a minecraft network, K8s is the perfect solution for this problem.  
My intend is to arquitect a Kubernetes cluster to handle at the same time, Minecraft server instances, Web APIs, databases, caches, proxies, Jenkins, Repositories, and others.
